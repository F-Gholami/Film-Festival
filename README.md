# Boston Film Festival

### Introduction
This webpage is a mockup for an imaginary outdoor film festival, which I designed and developed based on a brief with specific requirements. I also wrote a project outline brief for the imaginary client with sections that describe the stakeholders, goals, budget, timeline and technical specifications.

Both brief with requirments and the project brief can be found in the documents folder above.
